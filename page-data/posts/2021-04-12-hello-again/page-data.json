Jekyll had been my previous choice for maintaining this page, but since the last time that I intentionally used Jekyll, I've gone from being a Rubyist at heart to someone more used to the JavaScript and developing for the web.</p>\n<p>It's still rough around the edges, but that will change over time. To pair with the refresh and revamp of this site, I'm taking another jump into the past by ordering a November 2020 M1 MacBook Air, my first return to the Mac OS since 2016, where I began to use my 2009 MacBook Pro less and less, eventually replacing it with a Chromebook and then a Surface Pro. It's been a great few years, but Windows still isn't quite where I want it to be. WSL is great, but it's still clunky around the corners and the it's not as integrated as well as I'd like it to be, so I'm looking forwards getting back into the Unix roots of Mac OS again. There's another added bonus, though: the M1 SoC is ARM-based, which will fit in greatly with my Raspberry Pi server cluster.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-12","title":"Hello, Again"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/2021-04-12-hello-again/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460"]}
